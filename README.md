**FaceMaskDetection**
A YOLOv8-based deep learning model for detecting three classes of face mask usage: with_mask, without_mask, and mask_weared_incorrect. The model was trained on a labeled dataset of face images and optimized for object detection tasks.

**Project Overview
**
This project identifies whether a person is wearing a mask correctly, incorrectly, or not wearing a mask. The model is trained using the YOLOv8 architecture on a dataset containing 4,072 labeled instances.

**Installation**

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/DAlal1smss/FaceMaskDetection.git
   
3. Install required dependencies:

   pip install ultralytics
   
   pip install lxml

**Dataset Preparation
**
The dataset used in this project is the Face Mask Detection dataset downloaded from Kaggle.

It contains 853 images belonging to three classes: with_mask, without_mask, mask_weared_incorrect.

The dataset was originally provided in Pascal VOC (XML) format, and the annotations were converted into YOLO format (.txt) before training.

After extraction, the dataset was organized into the following structure:

images/        # All training & validation images

annotations/   # Original XML annotation files

labels/        # YOLO-format label files generated from XML

mask.yaml      # Dataset configuration file for YOLOv8

This structure is required for YOLOv8 training.

**Training Command
**

from ultralytics import YOLO

model = YOLO("yolov8n.pt")

model.train(
    data="mask.yaml",
    
    epochs=20,
    
    imgsz=416,
    
    batch=16
)

**Example Inference
**
from ultralytics import YOLO

model = YOLO("runs/detect/train2/weights/best.pt")

model.predict(source="try.jpg")


**How to Run the Model
**
from ultralytics import YOLO

model = YOLO("runs/detect/train2/weights/best.pt")

results = model.predict(source="path_to_image.jpg")

**Results**

The model was trained for 20 epochs using YOLOv8n.

Key performance outcomes include:

- Successful detection of all three mask classes
  
- Clear bounding boxes and confidence scores

- Stable training curves (loss decreasing across epochs)

Training outputs (loss curves, confusion matrix, mAP plots) are stored automatically inside:
runs/detect/train2/
